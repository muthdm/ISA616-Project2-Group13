# Repository Overview
This Repository is a place to store our data files in order to work collaboratively on this project over FSB data.

# Project Overview
The Farmer School of Business conducts annual surveys to learn about student's job placement post-graduation. The data is mixed with most coming from self-reported student surveys and the other observations coming from the Miami University database. Our goal with the data is to understand the macro placement and salary trends for FSB students over the last three years in order to assist Kirk Bogard, the Associate Vice President for Development and External Relations in FSB. Specifically, we will:

* Create a a graph that shows the average salary per year, per major of Farmer graduates.
* Overlay a graph of the previous year's average salary per year, per major of Farmer graduates
* Compare these graphs with national averages from other schools to show FSB’s success (if FSB performs better than the national average)

This will help Kirk Bogard by:

* Understanding of data that has been collected over the last 3 years in a structured way
* Having the average salary of each FSB major for past years
* Understanding of placement rates for each major


## Data Sources
