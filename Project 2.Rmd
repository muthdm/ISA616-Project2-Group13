## Written

**1. Define the client or audience for your data analysis solution.**

Our client is the Office of the Dean & External Relations. More specifically we will be working with Kirk Bogard, Associate VP for Development and External Relations in FSB.

**2. Define the client jobs. What jobs are your clients trying to get done?**

Understand the performance of FSB based on job placement and salary.

Understand which majors tend to have more students obtain jobs

Attract students, parents, and companies to FSB with facts and figures, rankings, and more

Work with current students to help find them jobs, internships, and other professional experiences

**3. Add pains. What are the pains before, during, and after your customer is trying to get their jobs done? Create a bullet point for every specific pain**

Unstructured data requiring lots of data cleaning before any analysis can begin

Lack of understanding trend changes of student placement and salary over time

Most data is over Farmer as a whole, not specific majors

**4. Add gains. What are the gains that your customer expects to get or will be surprised to benefit from your solution?**

Way of comparing Farmer Students to other schools to understand if student success/failures is specific to Farmer or if there are industry trends

Will obtain specific numbers of placement rates and average salaries for each major of past years

**5. Describe your intended solution. Give a bullet point for each major element of your product or solution.**

Create a a graph that shows average salary per year, per major of Farmer graduates and overlays these to compare

Compare these graphs with national averages from other schools to show FSB's success (if FSB performs better than the national average)

**6. What are the painkillers from your solution? List out those things in your solution that can kill the pain points of your client.**

Understanding of data that has been collected over the last 3 years in a structured way

Having the average salary of each FSB major for past years

Understanding of placement rates for each major

**7. What are the gain creators? List out the items that will add additional value to your customer, above and beyond addressing their current pain points.**

Allow Farmer to promote themselves in comparison to other schools

Our code and graphs provided can be adjusted and added to as FSB gets more data. This will allow them to get average salaries and placements for each year
